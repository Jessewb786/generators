This example contains:

- Using the Amazon API Gateway generator to fetch OpenAPI files from AWS
- Assign owners to the APIs (services and messages)
- Using the OpenAPI generator to process the information into EventCatalog
- Assigning the APIs to Services and Domains in EventCatalog

### Getting Started

1. Clone this project
1. Deploy the demo API to AWS in the `/backend` folder
  - Go to the `backend` folder and run `npm install`
  - Then run `npm run build && cdk deploy`
  - This will create a basic API in your AWS account that this demo will use.
1. Go back to the root of this project and run `npm install`
1. Get and configure the Amazon API Gateway and OpenAPI license key from [OpenAPI](https://eventcatalog.cloud) (14 day free trials)
1. Run the generators `npm run generate`
1. Run the catalog `npm run dev`
1. View your catalog at https://localhost:3000

### How the generator can help you

1. Document your APIs directly into EventCatalog
1. Assign owners to APIs
1. Assign routes to commands, queries and events
1. See the relationships between APIs, services and domains with the visualizer
1. Assign APIS to services and domains in your organization
1. Let your developers and teams quickly find APIS, how they work and who owns them.
